           <p>Hi everyone I am Rhyzza Rufino and I'm doing this site to share all of you what kind of a person I am.</p>
          <h2>My Weaknesses</h2>
           <p>Every girl have weaknesses, so have also. I am a little bit lazy at some places which I do not like. While playing time, I pass my lot of time there which is not a good habit, but I try my best to overcome my weaknesses.</p>
          <h3>My Ambitions in Life</h3>
           <p>Everybody has an ambition in life. Aim or ambition is the inner aspiration of man. No man can do anything in the world without aim. So, all of us should be very determined about our aim in life.
             Without good career planning, right from the start, one canâ€™t be on the right track. One has to set the goals in accordance with his or her broad career goals.
             I have studied biology and I will seat for the competitive entrance exam for admission to reputed medical college. I shall try to be a good and honest student. Then I shall be a qualified doctor. I will do all that to be a good doctor and will be sincere to it.</p>
          <h4>Conclusion<h4>
           <p>These are all the things which express me. Though nobody can be described in a few sets of sentences. One needs to have yet command of oneself before going to write something about in our life. Life is meant to be lived avidly and with visualization to do good for your fellow beings. Keeping this aim in mind, I have always desired to serve my everyone in whatever capacity I can.</p>
