<p><strong> Album: "THE FIRST STEP: CHAPTER THREE" </strong></p>
Writers: GODOK, Hyunsuk,Yoshi and Haruto
Released: 6th November,2020
 “Mmm” is bad. The song’s production is relatively free of the heavy EDM trappings which weighed down “Boy” and “I Love You”. Its basic but gripping beat has definite potential, and it would be nice to see Treasure continue to pursue this stripped-down sound in the future.
