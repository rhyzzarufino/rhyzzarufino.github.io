  <h3>My Strength</h3>
       <p>My Strength for me is the advice of my parents had a keen effect on my habits. I believe to speak the truth and try my best not to lie. My parents always advised me that if I commit a mistake, I should admit it. I try my best to do so. I know how to remain happy in every condition. Because I believe that: “Happiness is not out there; it’s in you.”
 I am a very adventurous person too and like to take the risk. I like to do a creative thing besides doing old stuff again and again. Learning new things is one thing which I always enjoy. I always update myself with the news and specially I love watching kdramas.
Alongith this, I fond of watching Dharmann videos he's an Motivational Speaker which is in different videos that he make have an motivational stories.He taught me a high moral lesson.</p>
