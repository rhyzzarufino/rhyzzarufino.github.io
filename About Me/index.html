  <h2>Discovering Myself</h2>
      <p>Growing up, I did not know who or what I wanted to be as a person. I was always in a rush to find myself. It wasn’t until my sophomore year in high school that I was starting to evolve as a person. It wasn’t my best year in high school, but it helped me become more independent, organized and also helped me figure out which career path I wanted to take. Having this happen at such a young age, I was determined to accomplish the goals I had set and work hard for the career I wanted. My goals were to finish high school, graduate, and start on my career path in the medical field to become a pediatrics nurse.
        After losing myself in the beginning of high school, I decided it was time to get my act together and bring up my grades. I used to think that having a lot of friends was the best thing in school. In reality, having a small circle of friends who motivate you and push you to achieve your goals was actually a better aspect. I changed my ways as to how I went about school, and I became more focused in my classes. I didn’t want to procrastinate on homework anymore, so each day I made sure it was all done before I did anything else. I organized my time wisely and made sure school was my number one priority.</p>
